Downloading Tableau Dashboards from Server/Online using TabCmd

After searching on google, tableau community extensively and watching youtube videos on how to download Tableau workbooks and dashboards with parameters using Tableau command prompt, I was able to successfully download the workbooks myself. Here I summarize the steps that worked out for me.

I am also attaching a separate batch file that automates the entire process of downloading the dashboards views.
